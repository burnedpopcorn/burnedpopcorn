## its a ME
### Did you know burned popcorn is bad for your health?

My somewhat finished stolen Projects include:
- Pizza Tower 1.1.0 Web Port (Noise Update)
- April 2021 Build of Pizza Tower (also a Web Port)
- Pizza Tower CheesedUP Web Port (Works for the most part)
- Sonic 3 AIR Web Port (basically stole it, but what didn't I steal on here anyways)
- Sonic Mania Plus Web Port (again, just stole it, didn't even compile it myself)
- Sonic 2 Community's Cut (stole it, modified it, and that's it)
- EaglerCraft Client Selector (many different Clients included)
- WAD Commander Re-Upload (Wayback Machine the goat)
- IndexedDB File Manager (barely seen any like it surprisingly)
- Archiving Removed Chrome Web Store Extensions (and hosting Happy Friday from a web page)

Projects I'm working on
- Updating my other ports (Mostly the Pizza Tower Ports)

I also have some other random, miscellaneous projects which you can find in my Repositories Tab, so check them out as well as my Pinned
