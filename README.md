### So I exist...

... Yeah, I'm surprised as well, and I mostly port games to the web browser, or modify and re-upload existing ports

Why? because school is boring as hell, why else

My somewhat finished stolen Projects include:
- Pizza Tower 1.1.0 Web Port (Noise Update)
- April 2021 Build of Pizza Tower (also a Web Port)
- Sonic 3 AIR Web Port (basically stole it, but what didn't I steal on here anyways)
- Sonic Mania Plus Web Port (again, just stole it, didn't even compile it myself)
- Sonic 2 Community's Cut (stole it, modified it, and that's it)
- EaglerCraft Client Selector (many different Clients included)
- WAD Commander Re-Upload (Wayback Machine the goat)

Projects I'm working on
- Super Mario 64 Plus Web Port (a PoC has been made)
- Pizza Tower Cheesed Up Web Port (maybe, might not happen)

I also have some other random, miscellaneous projects which you can find in my Repositories Tab, so check them out as well as my Pinned
:)
