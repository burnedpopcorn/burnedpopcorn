### Also to loypoll
screw you for taking down my Github repos for my Cheesed Up ports, and I'm never gonna stop making them/updating them.

also i never even made them to spite you in the first place, I just did it because I loved the mod, but i guess you dont care. and I would like to say this: 

You are your worst enemy, and no one else has or even could have ruined you the way you have. And why do I say that? Well, when I "joined" the PT community, I heard you were the worst person in there, and I thought "well what does he do that's so bad?". Well, I didn't even have to go to the expose website, or see testimonies from other people, no, you showed me yourself one of the many reasons why everyone hates you, so congratulations, you've made yourself ANOTHER enemy, out of the thousands you've already made, so, I ask you, what do you think made people hate you, because people would only start to hate you if they had a reason to hate you. Of course, I understand that there will always be people that hate on things no matter what it is, but when literally EVERYONE in a community hates you, its more likely there's a problem with YOU, and you should start thinking about that.

also, if you want the Source Code for Cheesed Up, talk to me on Discord
