## Unfortunate Update
As of 6/15/24, I will be on an long hiatus for an unknown amount of time. This is due to an incident that left me with out a means of updating ANY of my projects, so don't expect any updates
to roll out any time soon. My projects are NOT being discontinued, as I will immediately continue work on them whenever I get the chance

My somewhat finished stolen Projects include:
- Pizza Tower 1.1.0 Web Port (Noise Update)
- April 2021 Build of Pizza Tower (also a Web Port)
- Sonic 3 AIR Web Port (basically stole it, but what didn't I steal on here anyways)
- Sonic Mania Plus Web Port (again, just stole it, didn't even compile it myself)
- Sonic 2 Community's Cut (stole it, modified it, and that's it)
- EaglerCraft Client Selector (many different Clients included)
- WAD Commander Re-Upload (Wayback Machine the goat)

Projects I'm working on
- Super Mario 64 Plus Web Port (a PoC has been made)
- Updating my other ports

I also have some other random, miscellaneous projects which you can find in my Repositories Tab, so check them out as well as my Pinned

:)
